# ðŸ§  Machine Learning with TensorFlow & Python

Welcome to the **MachineLearning** repository!  
This repo contains experiments, models, and projects built using **Python** and **TensorFlow**.  
The goal is to explore various **machine learning** and **deep learning** concepts through practical implementations.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Implementations of **ML algorithms** from scratch and with TensorFlow
- Hands-on **deep learning models** (CNNs, RNNs, NLP, etc.)
- Data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations
- Reproducible experiments and modular code
